  "To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living.",
  "Under 'Reasons for Leaving Last Job,' never give the real reason, unless it's money or ambition.",
  "Skills can be taught. Character you either have or you don't have.",
  "Travel is about the gorgeous feeling of teetering in the unknown.",
  "Assume the worst. About everybody. But don't let this poisoned outlook affect your job performance. Let it all roll off your back. Ignore it. Be amused by what you see and suspect. Just because someone you work with is a miserable, treacherous, self-serving, capricious, and corrupt asshole shouldn't prevent you from enjoying their company, working with them, or finding them entertaining.",
  "I don't have to agree with you to like you or respect you.",
  "It's very rarely a good career move to have a conscience.",
  "The way you make an omelet reveals your character",
  "Basic cooking skills are a virtue... the ability to feed yourself and a few others with proficiency should be taught to every young man and woman as a fundamental skill. [It's] as vital to growing up as learning to wipe one's own ass, cross the street by oneself, or be trusted with money.",
  "Luck is not a business model",
  "Without experimentation, a willingness to ask questions and try new things, we shall surely become static, repetitive, and moribund.",
  "When dealing with complex transportation issues, the best thing to do is pull up with a cold beer and let somebody else figure it out.",
  "Maybe that's enlightenment enough: to know that there is no final resting place of the mind; no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom... is realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.",
  "Perhaps wisdom... is realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.",
  "I'm not afraid to look like an idiot",
  "Without new ideas success can become stale.",
  "I learned a long time ago that trying to micromanage the perfect vacation is always a disaster. That leads to terrible times.",
  "I'm a big believer in winging it. I'm a big believer that you're never going to find perfect city travel experience or the perfect meal without a constant willingness to experience a bad one. Letting the happy accident happen is what a lot of vacation itineraries miss, I think, and I'm always trying to push people to allow those things to happen rather than stick to some rigid itinerary.",
  "Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s OK. The journey changes you; it should change you... You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.",
  "It's been an adventure. We took some casualties over the years. Things got broken. Things got lost. But I wouldn't have missed it for the world.",
  "You learn a lot about someone when you share a meal together.",
  "What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast?",
  "I would like to see people more aware of where their food comes from. I would like to see small farmers empowered. I feed my daughter almost exclusively organic food.",
  "For a dinner date, I eat light all day to save room, then I go all in: I choose this meal and this order, and I choose you, the person across from me, to share it with. There's a beautiful intimacy in a meal like that.",
  "Don't dunk your nigiri in the soy sauce. Don't mix your wasabi in the soy sauce. If the rice is good, complement your sushi chef on the rice.",
  "Sometimes the greatest meals on vacations are the ones you find when Plan A falls through.",
  "To be treated well in places where you don't expect to be treated well, to find things in common with people you thought previously you had very, very little in common with, that can't be a bad thing.",
  "Being a vegan is a first-world phenomenon, completely self-indulgent.",
  "I'm not afraid to look like a big, hairy, smelly, foreign devil in Tokyo, though I do my best not to, I really do.",
